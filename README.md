# fetal_health
Fetal health classification entails the assessment of multiple parameters derived from monitoring devices and medical tests. The project utilizes a diverse dataset that encompasses a wide range of features, including cardiotocogram (CTG) readings, accelerations, and uterine contractions. The objective is to build robust classification models capable of accurately predicting fetal health status.
