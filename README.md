# Fetal health classification
Fetal health classification entails the assessment of multiple parameters derived from monitoring devices and medical tests. The project utilizes a diverse dataset that encompasses a wide range of features, including cardiotocogram (CTG) readings, accelerations, and uterine contractions. The objective is to build robust classification models capable of accurately predicting fetal health status.
Linear classifiers, such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), are employed initially to establish a baseline for model performance. Non-linear classifiers, including Random Forest, Decision Trees, and XGBoost, are subsequently explored to potentially improve classification accuracy.
## Findings
All the classification machine learning models scored well with an accuracy score greater than 85%, meaning that features used, all together directly affect the fetal health.
The RandomForestClassification model performed best with an accuracy score of 94.16%
